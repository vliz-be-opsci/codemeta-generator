# codemeta-generator

Goal of this repository is to provide a GitHub-action that can be deployed in the workflow of any github repository that contains software in need of decent codemeta.json file. 

The plan is that this action could smartly use available metadata in the github environement to complete and/or check any codemeta.json file. 
To do:
- investigate what metadata is available 
- to keep/merge/check possible manually provided metadata
(to use as info/inspo: https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/open-code-tracking/tree/main)

  
In the meantime we suggest to use (tool from Jorge)[] to create the codemeta file by hand.
